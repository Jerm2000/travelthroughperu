    <p>Welcome! Travelling can be way too stressful sometimes, even though it should be our way to get away from stress! Nervousness about having everything be perfect, finding the right hotel, hoping that the weather is nice, eating at the best and most authentic restaurants, etc. is all too common and a lot of times can make one less excited for the vacation. Travelling through Peru is here to help ease some of those fears by sharing awesome guides, tips, and tricks to making the most of your South American getaway. </p>
    <p>Note: Before travelling to Peru, make sure to visit the U.S. Department of State website to check on <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/peru-travel-advisory.html">current COVID-19 restrictions in Peru</a>.</p>
