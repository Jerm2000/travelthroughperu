        <h2>Why does this website exist?</h2>
        <p>
            This point of this website is to save vacationers going to Peru the annoyance of getting to their destination and having to waste a whole day wandering about with no goal in mind. Through the articles and pictures, I hope to provide you with the inspiration needed to "<em>seize the day</em>" and make the most of your time in this beautiful and history filled country.

            <p>Lima, the capital city of Peru, is home to 11 million people. It is one of the most populated cities in the world and is made up of 43 different districts. Most of the popular tourist spots are located within 3 of these districts, however. The photo shows part of the popular shoreline of the Miraflores district.</p>

        <h3>Welcome!</h3>
        <p>
            Bienvenido! If you're reading this, you're most likely planning a trip to Peru. Having visited Peru on multiple occasions myself, I know that it can be <strong>very</strong> frustrating sometimes having to visit tens of different websites trying to find places that actually seem worth visiting. I hope you are able to fill your itinerary with what you find here and have a wonderful trip to Peru!

        <p>Here are some important Spanish phrases to know before you land in Peru!</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Hola!</dt>
            <dd>Hello!</dd>
            <dt>Cómo estás/están?</dt>
            <dd>How are you (singular, plural)?</dd>
            <dt>Cómo te llamas/ se llaman?</dt>
            <dd>What is your (singular, plural) name?</dd>
        </dl>
        <ol>
            <li>These phrases are specifically for the Spanish spoken in Peru, if you go to other South American countries or to Spain, it is possible that these will be different.
                <ul>
                    <li>Although most countries follow this pattern, some, such as Argentina and Spain, use "vos" and "vosotros" conjugation forms. </li>
                    <li>For example, in Spain, instead of saying, "Cómo están?", you would say, "Cómo estáis?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
